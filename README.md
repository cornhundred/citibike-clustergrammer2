### Ideas
* use geopy to automatically find neighborhoods
* use google api to get elevation for stations
* calculate distance for each ride (preferably using actual maps routes)
* calculate elevation change for each ride
* calculate average velocity for each ride
* make network (similarity heatmap) views of all stations based on distance, connecting rides
* downsample data to view millions of rides from previous months
* use pivot tables to get age vs station-departure/station-arrivals
